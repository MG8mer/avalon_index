# ⚔️ Avalon Index 

Thanks for checking out **__Avalon Index__**! Simply put, it is a leveling bot where people in a server can gain XP through luck & class-based battling and server activity!

## 📈 Features

Avalon Index in terms of leveling allows you to configure the following through various commands:

- ➡️ Setting a channel for level-up messages to be sent to.
- ➡️ Setting & viewing roles that are earned when reaching a specific level in a server.
- ➡️ Setting & viewing roles that earn extra XP in a server (by a specific percentage).
- ➡️ Setting & viewing roles that cannot earn XP & channels where messaging (not battling) won't earn server XP in a server.


Avalon Index also has a myriad of useful and fun features! Including:

- 🎯 A `/start` & `/pick` command to initialize the bot for yourself and pick a class to use in battles.
- 🎯 A `/stats` command allowing you to view your class and server/global levels.
- 🎯 A `battle` command to allow you to fight friends in the server that you are in for global and server XP.
- 🎯 A `/leaderboard` command to see the members with the highest levels and XP.
- 🎯 A `/reset` command to reset your global level and class.
*And more!*
